# Speech To Pictogram
## Challenge Description

Autistic people tend to be visual learners. Several of non-verbal autistic use electronical devices to communicate using pictures. This challenge consists of implementing the other way around, recognizing voices and translating it to pictures to increase the understanding of autistic people with limited verbal language. 

Around 95% of what they learn comes from visual information. Although they can hear and several times understand what you say, the pictograms would increase their understanding of what it has been said.
